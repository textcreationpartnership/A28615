         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Short ACCOUNT OF THE LATTER END AND Dying Words OF FRANCIS HOWGIL,</head>
            <p>AS for the time of dear <hi>F. Howgil</hi> his Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (which he endured with much Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Chearfulneſs) he begun the Eleaventh of the Eleaventh Moneth, 1668. (and continued till the Twentieth Day of the ſame Moneth) and then departed this Life; having then, for the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Jeſus, been Priſoner <hi>Four Years</hi> and <hi>Eleaven Moneths:</hi> He was not unſenſible of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49686:3"/>Decay of his <hi>outward Man</hi> ſome time before, which moved him to a diſpoſal of his outward <hi>Eſtate,</hi> and the ſetting of his Houſe in order: His Love was very dear to his <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Fellow-labourers,</hi> with whom he had laboured and travelled in the Work of the Miniſtry; <hi>In Teſtimony whereof, he left to each of them ſomething, as a Remembrance of his Love; and alſo was mindful of the Church, and left a Legaſie to be diſtributed amongſt the Poor of the Houſhold of Faith in theſe Parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though the Time of his Departure did draw very nigh, and his Sickneſs encreaſed, yet in all that time he was in perfect and good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and oftentimes very fervent in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and uttered many comfortable Expreſſions, to the great Refreſhment of thoſe who were with him.</p>
            <p>And about two dayes before his going hence, being attended by his Dear Wife, and ſeveral Friends, he begun to ſay unto them, <hi>Friends, as to matter of words, you muſt not expect much more from me; neither is there any great need of it, as to ſpeak of Matters of Faith to you, who are ſatisfied; only, that you remember my Dear Love to all Friends, who enquire of me; for I ever loved Friends well, or any in whom Truth appeared. And truly God will own his People, as he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49686:3"/>hath even hitherto done, and as we have daily witneſſed; for, no ſooner had they made that Act againſt us for Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment (to the great Suffering of many good Friends) but the Lord ſtirred up Enemies againſt them, even three great Nations, whereby the Violence of their Hand was taken off: And I ſay again, God will own his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, even all thoſe that are faithful. And as for me, I am well, &amp; content to dye; I am not at all afraid of Death. And truly one thing was of late in my Heart, and that I intended to have written to</hi> G. F. <hi>and others, even that which I have obſerved, which thing is, That this Generation paſſeth faſt away; we ſee many good and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Friends within theſe few Years have been taken from us, and therefore Friends had need to watch, and be very faithful, ſo that we may leave a good (and not a bad) ſavour to the next ſucceeding Generation; for you ſee, that it is but a little time that any of us have to ſtay here.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And often, in the time of his Sickneſs, he ſaid, He was content to dye, and that he was ready; and praiſed God for thoſe many ſweet Enjoyments and Refreſhments he had received on that his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Houſe Bed, whereon he lay; freely forgiving all who had a hand in his Reſtraint.</p>
            <p>And he ſaid, <hi>This was the Place of my first Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment (for the Truth) here at this Town; and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49686:4"/>if it be the Place of my laying down the Body, well, I am content.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Several Perſons of note, Inhabitants in <hi>Appul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> aforeſaid, as the <hi>Mayor,</hi> and others, came to viſit him; ſome of which praying, <hi>That God might ſpeak Peace to his Soul</hi> (he ſweetly replyed, <hi>He hath done it</hi>) and they all ſpoke well of him: So that he hath left an exceeding good Teſtimony for the Lord in this Place, to the great Honour of Truth, and our mutual Comfort.</p>
            <p>And a few Hours before his Departure, ſome Friends (who lived ſeveral Miles from that Place) came to viſit him; he enquired of all their Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and pray'd very fervently (with many Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Expreſſions) <hi>That the Lord, by his Mighty Power, might preſerve them out of all ſuch things as would ſpot and defile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And a little after, he was ſaying ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Weeks (or a Time) after which Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhou'd be ended; but his Weakneſs was ſo great, and his Voice ſo low, that it was not fully heard by us.</p>
            <p>A little ſeaſon after, he recovering a little ſtrength, further ſaid, <hi>I have ſought the Way of the Lord from a Child, and lived innocently, as amongſt men; and if any enquire concerning my Latter End, let them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49686:4"/>know, that I dye in that Faith in which I lived, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And after theſe words, he ſpake ſome other in Prayer unto God, and ſweetly fin ſhed his Courſe in much Peace with the Lord, as we that were preſent had clear and perfect ground to believe; he being all along in a precious Heavenly Frame of Spirit, and was filled with the refreſhing Preſence of the Lord, which we alwayes felt to abound in him to his very laſt.</p>
            <p>F. H. <hi>dyed the 20th of the 11th Moneth,</hi> 1668. <hi>in the Fiftieth Year of his Age.</hi>
